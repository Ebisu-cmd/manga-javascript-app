# About
The main purpose of this project is to build a fully functioning JavaScript web application. This application lets users view a list of pokemon and see specific details about each pokemon. The application employs touch events for mobile users, which allows swiping between pokemon when in modal view. The application also features a search bar, where users can filter specific pokemon they are searching for.
